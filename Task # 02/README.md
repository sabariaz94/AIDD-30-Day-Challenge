🧩 Part A — Theory Answers
1. Nine Pillars Understanding
1.1 Why is using AI Development Agents better for your growth as a system architect?

Using AI Development Agents 🤖 for repetitive setup work frees the developer from time-consuming tasks and shifts their focus toward system-level thinking. This helps build architectural decision-making skills and improves the ability to guide AI tools through clear instructions, which is essential for becoming a strong system architect.

1.2 How do the Nine Pillars help a developer become an M-Shaped Developer?

The Nine Pillars 🏛️ combine architecture, testing, automation, specifications, and AI agents into one integrated workflow. Working with these elements builds deep competence in multiple areas, helping the developer grow into an M-Shaped professional with strong skills across several related domains.

2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
2.1 Why does Vibe Coding create problems after one week?

Vibe Coding 🎧 lacks structure and planning, which leads to confusion, inconsistent code, and forgotten requirements. After a week, the project becomes messy, harder to extend, and difficult to debug due to missing documentation and unplanned decisions.

2.2 How does Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

Specification-Driven Development 📝 avoids these issues by defining clear requirements before coding begins. This makes the system more predictable, easier to maintain, and simpler to test. With written specifications, the project stays organized and scalable.

3. Architecture Thinking
3.1 How does architecture-first thinking change the developer’s role?

Architecture-first thinking 🧩 shifts the developer’s role from simply writing code to designing complete systems. The developer becomes responsible for planning flows, organizing components, and guiding AI agents instead of only handling implementation details.

3.2 Why must developers think in layers and systems instead of raw code?

Developers must think in layers 🧱 because layered systems keep projects clean, modular, and scalable. This structure prevents tangled code and makes both human developers and AI agents more effective in understanding, maintaining, and extending the system.

💻 Part B — Practical Task
1️⃣ CLI Prompt Used
Generate a one-paragraph specification for an email validation function. Requirements: it must contain “@”, it must include a valid domain extension such as .com or .org, and it must return clear error messages for each validation failure.

2️⃣ Output Specification Generated by AI CLI

The email validation function 📧 should verify that the input contains one “@” symbol dividing the local part and the domain. It must also confirm that the domain ends with a valid extension such as .com, .org, or .net 🌐. For any issue, the function should return clear error messages ⚠️ like “Missing @ symbol,” “Invalid domain,” or “Incorrect domain extension.” If everything passes, it should return a success message confirming the email is valid ✔️.
