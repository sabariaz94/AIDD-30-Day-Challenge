PART A — Research Questions (Short Answers)

(Based on official Google AI documentation for Gemini 3.0)

1. What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?

Answer:
Gemini 3.0 introduces major advancements in intelligence, reasoning, and overall performance. It features a significantly larger 1 million–token context window, enhanced multistep reasoning, richer and more flexible multimodal inputs, and a new parameter that allows developers to control the model’s internal reasoning depth. These improvements make Gemini 3.0 more powerful, efficient, and capable of handling complex real-world tasks.

2. How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?

Answer:
Gemini 3.0 boosts coding workflow efficiency with a 35% improvement in coding accuracy, solving more GitHub issues compared to Gemini 2.5. Its expanded 1M-token context window allows developers to load entire codebases at once, enabling deep code understanding. Additionally, the model excels at solving complex programming tasks and managing multi-step automation workflows with higher reliability.

3. How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?

Answer:
Gemini 3.0 enhances multimodal processing through the new media_resolution parameter, allowing developers to control the precision of image and video analysis. Higher resolution settings help the model read fine text, detect small visual elements, and analyze detailed content, while balancing token usage and latency. This results in superior visual comprehension across diverse media.

4. Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.

Answer:
Two notable tools introduced with Gemini 3.0 include:

Nano Banana Pro — A highly advanced image generation and vision tool offering improved quality, higher resolution, and the ability to blend up to 14 reference images into a single composition.

Google Antigravity — A next-generation, agent-first development environment (IDE) designed to transform software development workflows with intelligent automation and deep AI integration.
